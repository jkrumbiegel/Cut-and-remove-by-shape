# Cut-and-remove-by-shape
An inkscape extension to cut an open path with a closed one and deleting the parts covered (or not) by it. Like destructive clipping.

This is useful for pen plotters and similar devices that cannot deal with clipping masks, but need actually shortened path commands to steer them.
For some reason, the established boolean commands only work with closed paths, not with the open ones commonly encountered with plotters and the like.
